# Contributing to the Augur Project
Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the Augur Project! Before you start, please view our [READEME](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-core/blob/master/README.md) and our [code of conduct.](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-core/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

### Issues and Pull Requests
IMPORTANT: Please refrain from filing new issues in this repository. Instead, all new issues should be filed in our new [monorepo](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur). This is a new repository we have created for the Augur version 2.0 code, and we would like to consolidate all issues for Augur version 1.0 and 2.0 here. When [raising an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/), please follow the appropriate issue template in the root directory.

[Pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) are welcome!  Make sure to run the tests (via docker is easiest) and verify the linter (Solium) doesn't complain.  Make sure commit messages are informative and concise.

### Communication
Finally, join the Augur Project on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/faud6Fx)!

Happy Coding!
